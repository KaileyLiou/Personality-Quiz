# Personality Quiz

This project is an interactive personality quiz that I made for fun. It's a BuzzFeed-style quiz that will reveal your true personality type after answering six dessert-related questions. There are four different outcomes: cozy, social, elegant, and chill. Or, you could be a blend.

I made this website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I used VS Code and Replit.

Something that I struggled with was getting the images to be responsive when the screen changes size. I was also initially confused about event listeners and using the DOM API, but I now understand them better. I learned a lot of new JavaScript concepts while coding.
